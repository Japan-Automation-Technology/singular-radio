# Vercel Web Analytics Implementation

## Summary
Successfully installed and configured Vercel Web Analytics for this Next.js App Router project.

## Changes Made

### 1. Package Installation
- Installed `@vercel/analytics` version 1.6.1 using npm
- Updated `package.json` to include the new dependency
- Updated `package-lock.json` with the new package and its dependencies

### 2. Code Changes
**Modified: app/layout.tsx**
- Added import statement: `import { Analytics } from "@vercel/analytics/next"`
- Added `<Analytics />` component inside the `<body>` tag, after the main content div
- Placement ensures analytics tracking is loaded on all pages while maintaining the existing layout structure

## Implementation Details
This is an App Router project (Next.js 16.1.4 with app directory), so the Analytics component was added to the root layout file (`app/layout.tsx`). The component is placed at the end of the body tag, which is the recommended location according to Vercel's documentation.

## Verification
✅ Dependencies installed successfully (1343 packages added)
✅ Build completed successfully with no errors
✅ TypeScript compilation passed
✅ Linter ran with no errors
✅ All changes staged with git

## Files Modified
- `app/layout.tsx` - Added Analytics import and component
- `package.json` - Added @vercel/analytics dependency
- `package-lock.json` - Updated with new package dependencies

The implementation follows Vercel's best practices and preserves all existing code structure and functionality.
